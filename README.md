# Dungeons and Datums
Dungeons and Datums is a Web and Android OS application that allows for an intuitive and interactive tool for Dungeons and Dragons players to more easily Manage campaigns, encounters, and players whether playing across the table or through the internet.

Created by Matthew Kurtz and John Millner, this project hopes to offer useful tools that help expedite some of the more tedious aspects of keeping track of the complexities of the game such as maintaining stats, dice rolls and modifiers, attacks, spells, spell slots, monster managment, NPC's, and many more. Along with all this we plan on eventually expanding the game to have loot generators, and customized monster groups tailored for a specific team to ensure a challenge!

This fork will focus on the encounter manager, created in Java
